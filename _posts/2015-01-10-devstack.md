## Keystone doesn't start after ./rejoin-stack.sh

After running ./rejioin-stack.sh under devstack directory, keystone service fail to start, I check with:

~~~bash
ls -l /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/
~~~

to see if keystone.conf presents, it doesn't, that can be the reason why keystone does not start, run:

~~~bash
sudo ln -s /etc/apache2/sites-available/keystone.conf /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/keystone.conf
sudo service apache2 restart
~~~

then everything goes fine.
